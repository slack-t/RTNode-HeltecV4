# RTNode-HeltecV4 — Reticulum Transport Node for Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4 (with support for V3)

A custom firmware for the **Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4** (ESP32-S3 + SX1262) that operates as a **Transport Node** — bridging a local LoRa radio network with a remote TCP/IP backbone (such as [rmap.world](https://rmap.world)) over WiFi.

This project was primarily developed with the use of AI assistance.

Built on [microReticulum](https://github.com/attermann/microReticulum) (a C++ port of the [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/) network stack) and the [RNode firmware](https://github.com/markqvist/RNode_Firmware) by Mark Qvist.

## Features

- **Bidirectional LoRa ↔ TCP bridging** — local LoRa mesh nodes can reach the global Reticulum backbone and vice versa
- **Web-based configuration portal** — WiFi SSID/password, backbone host/port, LoRa parameters, all configurable via captive portal
- **OLED status display** — real-time status indicators for LoRa, WiFi, WAN (backbone), LAN (local TCP), plus IP address, port, and airtime
- **Optional local TCP server** — serve local devices on your WiFi in addition to the backbone connection
- **Automatic reconnection** — WiFi and TCP connections recover from drops with exponential backoff
- **ESP32 memory-optimized** — table sizes, timeouts, and caching tuned for the constrained MCU environment
- **Dual board support** — supports both Heltec V3 (8MB flash) and V4 (16MB flash, 2MB PSRAM) with automatic board and PSRAM detection

## Hardware

This firmware was designed for the **Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4**. This board was chosen for its 2MB PSRAM and LoRa capabilities. While the V3 is supported, it uses the ESP32-S3FN8 which has **no PSRAM**. The firmware **detects PSRAM at runtime** and allocates the TLSF memory pool from SPIRAM when available, falling back to internal SRAM (~170 KB) on boards without PSRAM.

| Component | Heltec V3 | Heltec V4 |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **MCU** | ESP32-S3 (ESP32-S3FN8) | ESP32-S3 (ESP32-S3FH4R2) |
| **Flash** | 8 MB | 16 MB |
| **PSRAM** | None | 2 MB (QSPI) |
| **Radio** | SX1262 | SX1262 + PA (see below) |
| **TX Power** | Up to 22 dBm | Up to 28 dBm |
| **Display** | SSD1306 OLED 128×64 | SSD1306 OLED 128×64 |
| **WiFi** | 2.4 GHz 802.11 b/g/n | 2.4 GHz 802.11 b/g/n |
| **USB** | Native USB CDC | Native USB CDC |

The Heltec V4 has two board revisions that use different front-end modules. The firmware auto-detects the FEM type at boot:

| Revision | PA | TX control | RX control |
|----------|----|-----------|------------|
| V4.2 | GC1109 | CSD + CPS (CTX driven by DIO2) | CSD low |
| V4.3 | KCT8103L | CSD + CTX (CPS driven by DIO2) | CSD + CTX low |

A single `rtnode_heltec_v4` binary runs correctly on both revisions.

## Quick Start

### Option A: Web Flasher (easiest — no tools required)

Open **[jrl290.github.io/RTNode-HeltecV4](https://jrl290.github.io/RTNode-HeltecV4/)** in Chrome or Edge, connect your RTNode via USB, and follow the two-step flow:

1. **Detect** — click *Detect* and select your device from the browser's serial port picker. The flasher identifies the board (V3 or V4) automatically using PSRAM detection.
2. **Flash** — choose *Update firmware* (app only, settings preserved) or *Full install* (erases everything — use for first-time installs), then click *Flash Firmware*.

> Web Serial requires **Chrome 89+** or **Microsoft Edge**. Firefox and Safari are not supported.  
> On Linux, add your user to the `dialout` group first: `sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER` (then log out and back in).

### Option B: flash.py (Python CLI)

The easiest way to flash from the command line. You only need Python 3 and a USB cable.

```bash
# Clone this repo (or download just flash.py + the firmware binary)
git clone https://github.com/jrl290/RTNode-HeltecV4.git
cd RTNode-HeltecV4

# Download latest firmware from GitHub Releases and flash
# (auto-detects V3 vs V4 from flash size)
python flash.py

# Optional: use your machine's installed esptool instead of the bundled copy
python flash.py --use-system-esptool

# Or specify board explicitly
python flash.py --board v3
python flash.py --board v4

# Or flash a local binary
python flash.py --file rtnode_heltec_v4.bin
```

By default, `flash.py` uses the bundled `Release/esptool/esptool.py` for reproducible flashing. Only use `--use-system-esptool` if you explicitly want to override that with a host-installed esptool.

The flash utility auto-detects whether a V3 or V4 is connected by querying the flash size (8MB = V3, 16MB = V4). You can override with `--board v3` or `--board v4`. It will list all available serial ports and prompt you to choose one. If no ports are detected, you may need to hold the **BOOT** button while pressing **RESET** to enter download mode.

### Option C: Build from Source (PlatformIO)

For development or customization:

```bash
# Prerequisites: PlatformIO installed (VS Code extension or CLI)

git clone https://github.com/jrl290/RTNode-HeltecV4.git
cd RTNode-HeltecV4

# Build for V4
pio run -e rtnode_heltec_v4

# Build for V3
pio run -e rtnode_heltec_v3

# Flash (via PlatformIO)
pio run -e rtnode_heltec_v4 -t upload

# Or create a merged binary and flash with the utility
python flash.py --merge-only    # creates merged firmware bin
python flash.py                 # flash it (auto-detects board)

# Monitor serial output (optional)
pio device monitor -e rtnode_heltec_v4
```

### Option D: Manual esptool Flash

If you have the merged binary (`rtnode_heltec_v4.bin`), you can flash it with a single esptool command:

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 \
  write_flash -z --flash_mode qio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 16MB \
  0x0 rtnode_heltec_v4.bin
```

Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with your serial port (`/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS, `COM3` on Windows).

On first boot (or if no configuration is found), the device automatically enters the **Configuration Portal**.

## Configuration Portal

### Entering Config Mode

The config portal activates automatically on:
- **First boot** — when no saved configuration exists
- **Button hold >5 seconds** — hold the PRG button for 5+ seconds, the device reboots into config mode

When active, the device creates a WiFi access point named **`RNode-Boundary-Setup`** (open network). A captive portal should appear automatically when you connect; if not, browse to `http://192.168.4.1`.

### Config Page Options

The web form has four sections:

#### 📶 WiFi Network
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **WiFi** | Enable/Disable (disable for LoRa-only repeater mode) |
| **SSID** | Your WiFi network name |
| **Password** | WiFi password |

#### 🌐 TCP Backbone
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Mode** | `Disabled` or `Client (connect to backbone)` |
| **Backbone Host** | IP address or hostname of backbone server (e.g. `rmap.world`) |
| **Backbone Port** | TCP port (default: `4242`) |

#### 📡 Local TCP Server (optional)
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Local TCP Server** | Enable/Disable — runs a TCP server on your WiFi for local Reticulum nodes to connect |
| **TCP Port** | Port to listen on (default: `4242`) |

#### 📻 LoRa Radio
| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frequency** | e.g. `867.200` MHz — must match your other RNodes |
| **Bandwidth** | 7.8 kHz – 500 kHz (typically `125 kHz`) |
| **Spreading Factor** | SF6 – SF12 (typically `SF7` for backbone, `SF10` for long range) |
| **Coding Rate** | 4/5 – 4/8 |
| **TX Power** | 2 – 28 dBm |

#### 📍 Device Advertisement
Optional: announce this node and its parameters on the Reticulum network so external maps such as [rmap.world](https://rmap.world) can automatically place a pin for it. **Disabled by default** — only enable if you want this node to be publicly listed.

When enabled, the firmware periodically (~every 6 hours, matching the Reticulum default) emits an interface-discovery announce as described in the [Reticulum manual](https://reticulum.network/manual/interfaces.html). The announce is sent on the destination `rnstransport.discovery.interface` and contains:

- Interface type (`RNodeInterface`) and the node's transport-identity hash
- Discovery name (`RTNode-<short-hash>`)
- Latitude, longitude and height (decimal degrees / metres)
- Operating LoRa parameters (frequency, bandwidth, spreading factor, coding rate)
- IFAC network name and key, when configured

The payload is sealed with an LXMF proof-of-work stamp (cost 14, matching `RNS/Discovery.py`'s `DEFAULT_STAMP_VALUE`), and the resulting stamp is cached so the proof-of-work only re-runs when the advertised parameters change.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Advertise Device** | Enable/Disable advertising this node's parameters |
| **Latitude** | GPS latitude in decimal degrees (e.g. `37.774929`). North positive, South negative. Leave blank to omit |
| **Longitude** | GPS longitude in decimal degrees (e.g. `-122.419416`). East positive, West negative. Leave blank to omit |
| **Use Browser Location** | Button that fills the latitude/longitude fields from the browser's geolocation service (requires user permission; some browsers block it on plain HTTP origins) |
| **Randomize Offset** | When enabled, the *advertised* coordinates are shifted by a deterministic per-device offset of approximately half a kilometre (about half a mile) for privacy. The exact stored coordinates are not changed, and the offset is stable across announces so the pin doesn't move around |

After saving, the device reboots with the new configuration applied.

## OLED Display Layout

The 128×64 OLED is split into two panels:

### Left Panel — Status Indicators (64×64)

```
 ● LORA          ← filled circle = radio online
 ○ wifi          ← unfilled circle = WiFi disconnected
 ● WAN           ← filled = backbone TCP connected
 ● LAN           ← filled = local TCP client connected
 ────────────────
 Air:0.3%        ← current LoRa airtime
 ▓▓▓▓▓ |||||||   ← battery, signal quality
```

- **Filled circle (●)** = active/connected
- **Unfilled circle (○)** = inactive/disconnected
- Labels are UPPERCASE when active, lowercase when inactive (except LAN which is always uppercase)
- **LAN row is hidden** when the Local TCP Server is disabled in configuration — the remaining layout stays in place

### Right Panel — Device Info (64×64)

```
 ▓▓ RTNode-HV4 ▓▓  ← title bar (inverted)
 867.200MHz       ← LoRa frequency
 SF7 125k         ← spreading factor & bandwidth
 ────────────────  ← separator
 192.168.1.42     ← WiFi IP address (or "No WiFi")
 Port:4242        ← Local TCP server port
 ────────────────  ← separator
```

- **Port** shows the Local TCP server port (the port local nodes connect to), not the backbone port
- **Port line is hidden** when the Local TCP Server is disabled

## Interface Modes

The firmware runs up to **three RNS interfaces** simultaneously, using different interface modes to control announce propagation and routing behavior:

### LoRa Interface — `MODE_ACCESS_POINT`

The LoRa radio operates in **Access Point mode**. In Reticulum, this means:
- The interface broadcasts its own announces but **blocks rebroadcast of remote announces** from crossing to LoRa
- This prevents backbone announces (hundreds of remote destinations) from flooding the limited-bandwidth LoRa channel
- Local nodes discover the transport node directly; the transport node answers path requests for remote destinations from its cache

### TCP Backbone Interface — `MODE_BOUNDARY`

The TCP backbone connection uses `MODE_BOUNDARY` (`0x20`), a custom transport mode adapted for the memory-constrained ESP32 environment. In this mode:
- Incoming announces from the backbone are received and cached, but **not stored in the path table by default** — only stored when specifically requested via a path request from a local LoRa node
- This prevents the path table (limited to 48 entries on ESP32) from being overwhelmed by thousands of backbone destinations
- When the path table needs to be culled, **backbone-learned paths are evicted first**, preserving locally-needed LoRa paths

### Optional Local TCP Server — `MODE_ACCESS_POINT`

If enabled, a TCP server on the WiFi network allows local Reticulum nodes to connect. It also uses Access Point mode, with the same announce filtering as LoRa.

**Implementation details:**
- Each TCP interface must have a **unique name** to produce a unique interface hash — the backbone uses `"TcpInterface"` and the local server uses `"LocalTcpInterface"`. Without distinct names, both interfaces produce the same hash, causing the interface map lookup to fail when routing packets.
- TCP interfaces are configured with a **10 Mbps bitrate**, which causes Reticulum's Transport to prefer TCP paths over LoRa paths (typically ~1–10 kbps) when both are available for the same destination.
- When the Local TCP Server is disabled, its status indicator (LAN) and port number are hidden from the OLED display.

## Routing & Memory Customizations

The ESP32-S3 has limited RAM compared to a desktop Reticulum node. Several customizations were made to the microReticulum library to operate reliably within these constraints:

### Table Size Limits

| Table | Default (Desktop) | RTNode-HeltecV4 | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Path table (`_destination_table`) | Unbounded | **48 entries** | Prevents unbounded growth; backbone-learned paths evicted first |
| Hash list (`_hashlist`) | 1,000,000 | **32** | Packet dedup list; small is fine for low-throughput LoRa |
| Path request tags (`_max_pr_tags`) | 32,000 | **32** | Pending path requests rarely exceed a few dozen |
| Known destinations | 100 | **24** | Identity cache; rarely need more on a transport node |
| Max queued announces | 16 | **4** | Outbound announce queue; LoRa is slow, no point queuing many |
| Max receipts | 1,024 | **20** | Packet receipt tracking |

### Timeout Reductions

| Setting | Default | RTNode-HeltecV4 | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Destination timeout | 7 days | **1 day** | Free memory faster; stale paths re-resolve automatically |
| Pathfinder expiry | 7 days | **1 day** | Same as above |
| AP path time | 24 hours | **6 hours** | AP paths go stale faster in mesh environments |
| Roaming path time | 6 hours | **1 hour** | Mobile nodes change paths frequently |
| Table cull interval | 5 seconds | **60 seconds** | Less CPU overhead on culling |
| Job/Clean/Persist intervals | 5m/15m/12h | **60s/60s/60s** | More frequent housekeeping for MCU stability |

### Selective Backbone Caching

The most critical optimization: **backbone announces are not stored in the path table by default**. A backbone like `rmap.world` may advertise hundreds of destinations. Storing them all would evict every local LoRa path.

Instead:
1. Backbone announces are received and their packets cached to flash storage
2. When a local LoRa node requests a path, the transport node checks its cache and responds directly
3. Only **specifically requested** paths get a path table entry
4. Path table culling prioritizes evicting backbone entries over local ones

### Default Route Forwarding

When a transport-addressed packet arrives from LoRa but the transport node has no path table entry for it, the firmware:
1. Strips the transport headers (converts `HEADER_2` → `HEADER_1/BROADCAST`)
2. Forwards the raw packet to the backbone interface
3. Creates reverse-table entries so proofs can route back to the sender

This acts as a **default route** — any packet the transport node can't route locally gets forwarded to the backbone.

### Cached Packet Unpacking Fix

The original microReticulum `get_cached_packet()` function called `update_hash()` after deserializing cached packets from flash. However, `update_hash()` only computes the packet hash — it does **not** parse the raw bytes into fields like `destination_hash`, `data`, `flags`, etc.

This was changed to call `unpack()` instead, which parses all packet fields AND computes the hash. Without this fix, path responses contained empty destination hashes and were silently dropped by LoRa nodes.

> **Note:** `unpack()` only parses the plaintext routing envelope (destination hash, flags, hops, transport headers). It does not decrypt the end-to-end encrypted payload. Every Reticulum transport node performs equivalent header parsing during normal routing — this is standard behavior, not a security concern.

### Path Table Update Fix

The C++ `std::map::insert()` method silently does nothing when a key already exists — unlike Python's `dict[key] = value` which replaces. The original microReticulum code used `insert()` to update path table entries, meaning stale LoRa paths were never replaced by newer TCP paths (or vice versa).

This was fixed by calling `erase()` before `insert()`, ensuring updated path entries always replace stale ones. Without this fix, the transport node would continue routing packets via an old interface even after a better path was learned.

### Interface Name Uniqueness

Each RNS interface must have a **unique name** because the name is hashed to produce the interface identifier used in path table lookups. If two interfaces share the same name, they produce the same hash, and `std::map` can only store one — causing the Transport layer to fail to resolve the correct outbound interface for packets.

The TcpInterface constructor accepts an explicit `name` parameter: the backbone uses `"TcpInterface"` and the local server uses `"LocalTcpInterface"`.

## Connecting to the Backbone

### Example: Connect to rmap.world

In the configuration portal:
1. Set WiFi SSID and password
2. Set TCP Backbone Mode to **Client**
3. Set Backbone Host to `rmap.world`
4. Set Backbone Port to `4242`
5. Save and reboot

### Example: Local rnsd Server

On your server, configure `rnsd` with a TCP Server Interface in `~/.reticulum/config`:

```ini
[interfaces]
  [[TCP Server Interface]]
    type = TCPServerInterface
    listen_host = 0.0.0.0
    listen_port = 4242
```

Then configure the transport node as a **Client** pointing to your server's IP.

### Example: rnsd Connects to Transport Node

On your server, configure `rnsd` with a TCP Client Interface:

```ini
[interfaces]
  [[TCP Client to Transport Node]]
    type = TCPClientInterface
    target_host = <transport-node-ip>
    target_port = 4242
```

Set the transport node's **Local TCP Server** to **Enabled** (port 4242).
